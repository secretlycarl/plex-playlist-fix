# plex-playlist-fix
companion for plex-playlist-sync that adds missing songs to plex playlists

CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT YET WORKING COMPLETELY

This script is meant to be used in conjunction with plex-playlist-sync in Docker. It's probably possible to combine them into one but I don't have the skills for that. This script will read through the CSV files of missing songs generated by plex-playlist-sync, then search through a directory of music files, and then try to match files it finds with the songs listed in the CSVs, and then add them to the appropriate Plex playlist.

Usage

Set up the config file with your information

Set up the run command to mount your folders with CSVs and mp3s

Build the docker image

Run the docker run command
